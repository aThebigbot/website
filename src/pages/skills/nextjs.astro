      <p class="mb-4 mt-4">
        Next.js has been one of my favorite frameworks. In fact, I initially discovered it because I
        wanted a more structured routing system with React, not like react-router. But then, I found
        out that there were many features that could help me create large web pages with many
        functionalities.
