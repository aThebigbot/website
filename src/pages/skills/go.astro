        The Go Programming Language
      </h1>
      <p class="mb-4 mt-4">
        My first encounter with Go dates back to 2022 when I initially used it as a language for
        creating command-line interfaces (CLIs). However, in a short amount of time, I realized its
        incredibly powerful capabilities. I began to acquaint myself with it through the free course
        by Traversy Media (you can find it here), which provided me with a general understanding.
        Right after the initial tests, I started to love the language for its performance and
        versatility. Today, I can use it smoothly to create high-performance web servers.
